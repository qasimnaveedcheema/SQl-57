3. Sales Representatives
Weâ€™d like to see just the FirstName, LastName, and HireDate of all the employees with the Title of Sales Representative. 
Write a SQL statement that returns only those employees.
Query:
select FirstName,LastName,HireDate from Employees where Title = 'Sales Representative';
