13. OrderDetails amount per line item
In the OrderDetails table, we have the fields UnitPrice and Quantity. Create a new field, TotalPrice, that multiplies these two together. 
Weâ€™ll ignore the Discount field for now.
In addition, show the OrderID, ProductID, UnitPrice, and Quantity. Order by OrderID and ProductID.

Query:
select UnitPrice,Quantity,OrderID,ProductID,
TotalPrice = UnitPrice * Quantity
from  [Order Details] order by OrderID,ProductID;
