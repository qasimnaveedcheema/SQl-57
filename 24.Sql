24. Customer list by region
A salesperson for Northwind is going on a business trip to visit customers, and would like to see a list of all customers, sorted by region, alphabetically.
However, he wants the customers with no region (null in the Region field) to be at the end, instead of at the top, where youâ€™d normally find the null values. 
Within the same region, companies should be sorted by CustomerID.

Query:
select CustomerID,CompanyName,Region
from Customers

order by 
	case 
	when Region is null then 1
	else 0
	END,
	Region,CustomerID;
