11. Showing only the Date with a DateTime field
In the output of the query above, showing the Employees in order of BirthDate, we see the time of the BirthDate field, which we donâ€™t want. 
Show only the date portion of the BirthDate field.

Query:
select FirstName,LastName,Title,DateonlyBirthDate= convert(date, BirthDate) from Employees 
order by BirthDate;
